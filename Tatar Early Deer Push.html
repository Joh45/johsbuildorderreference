<h3>notes:</h3>
<p class="centerjustify">I've been seeing some other players especially in arena and michi games who push their deer 
    very soon.  This is in many build orders on this site already, but i often end up not doing it, but this build is focused on it.
	They do not go for the boar asap, and I actually think going for the boar early is sometimes stressful.  It can be
    effective to lure boars extremely early especially for civs like the lithuanians, persians, and maybe chinese, who
    can all pretty much get their first boar right away, and then do a fast feudal and/or fast castle, usually allowing
    them to try for a knight rush at 12-14 minutes, pretty early for knights for most people, or i would guess the chinese
    would go with feudal archers.  Now this is fine, it's a good idea to try this, but trying to do it is stressful, it
    stresses your economy out, you have to force drop food, you might get housed, and you still have to go get the deer, 
    and it's hard to push deer when there's more things to focus on like houses, the enemy, etc.  Now one civ i like Tatars, 
    partially because sheep give them more food and whenever they build a tc, two sheep appear, this seems to be 
    excellent for 4 tc booming, but for the dark age, the more food from sheep is what matters.  Extending the lifespan of 
    sheep is probably a good idea for them too, so if i can be eating deer at the start instead of sheep, then get 
    some on berries, get the deer over and done with, then lure the boar, and then still have sheep and berries left over,
    that seems great.  This might be better to do on closed maps like arena and michi.  Maybe less so on black forest and 
    amazon tunnel, as those maps are crazy becuase you have to send out early villagers to build walls, not because it's actually a good idea,
    but because your insane team will get mad and resign if you don't (i'd love to make a black forest team with good or prepared players
    that does not wall and uses the economic advantage of that to build early siege or something).  This idea is maybe bad for 
	arabia because the enemy can rush you or lame your boar a lot more easily, so maybe if you were going to try this on those open maps you'd push 
	one or two but not all 4, idk.  Anyway, the whole plan of this build is push deer early, keep sheep alive, don't let the boars bother 
	you as much, and get a good castle time, and be prepared to
    build 4 tcs and a castle in early castle age.  This is a fast castle build order.
