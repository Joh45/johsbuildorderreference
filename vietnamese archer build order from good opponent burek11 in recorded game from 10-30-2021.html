<h3>notes:</h3>
<p class="centerjustify">Burek11 was vietnamese in this game, he had a great archer rush.  It wasn't as well defended
by trench dog as it normally would have been because I was having problems with a scout rush that should have been easy
to deal with, even though i think i only actually lost one villager to it, it was distracting enough and enough of a threat that trench dog
needed to help me, so his eagle warriors were not in his town when the first archers arrived.  The main thing I felt was different about burek11's build order
from most build orders I try to do was burek11's building phase.  He kind of ignored food and even gold mining while he was going up to Feudal
He had 4 builders while advancing and 7 immediately after advancing to feudal, all taken from food.  His first gold miners were
also taken from food, he built two ranges and started making archers before getting any farms.  he also had a faster feudal because
he did not need to get 3 gold miners.  With all the builders, he was able to make an almost too large and extended amount of defensive palisade walls and he still clicked up to Castle
at 20 minutes.  At 23 minutes he is in castle with 27 archers, all of which are attacking, one big group on each side of trench dog's town. The other enemy player,
who i forget the name of now, who wasn't very good, but did kind of beat me, had a walling system i liked a lot better, and imited in a later game.</p>
