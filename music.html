    <h4>notes and thoughts:</h4>
    <br>
    <p>1. it may take a while for your browser to actually load all the tracks.  It won't work right away.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>
      2. there's something
      wrong with the player not playing the next track sometimes, sometimes it goes back to the first one, but you can just click the 
      little dot to the end over and over, and this will make it work right enough to use, it will skip 2 at first, then start skipping only one.
      I could fix this eventually, if you're one of the 2-5 people reading this maybe you can probably just fix it locally right now, 
      the problem is in audioplayer.js, but i'm not going to have time to fix it in the near future.</p>
      <br>
      <p>3. I'd like to add a skip track 
      button or maybe make this into a semi-radio-player that plays a track at random, and i can do both those things but don't have time for that right
      now either</p>
      <br>
      <p>4. Those two guitar covers are obviously not me, they are by a youtube channel named family jules, which i didn't want to write there.</p>
        <br>
        <p>5. The song Emnity from the Empire Earth soundtrack was used in the background of several history channel and other documentaries throughout the 90's and
          early 2000's.  It was also in several other game soundtracks and was called other things.  It was also in a sci fi channel show called farscape a lot.   
          After some research i did in maybe 2004 about where this song really came from, I began to believe that the original song that all the game and tv show 
          and documentary songs were based off of was behold the darkness by medwyn goodall, but who knows?</p>
        <br>
        <p>6. Terry Devine King's songs were also used in several historical documentaries, more likely to be on discovery.  He ended up writing some avengers music.  
          There was one good documentary about the incas i used to like (though i guess they weren't added to the game until much later),
          if i happen to find it, maybe i'll make a documentaries page on here.  His music was written for these shows, but the shows tended to be about one or 
          another civilization from age of empires, and it's clear from listening to it that he was not thinking of the documentary he was supposedly contracted to write songs for.
          He was probably thinking of age of empires.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>7. I don't think this is the best music in the world, but i do kind of like it enough to put it all here.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>8. Working cds of the original age of empires 1 are i guess rare these days, so most of the soundtracks on youtube are in some type of midi,
          maybe from the several pirated versions there are.  It's to the point that if anyone thinks about it, which i hope they don't, they probably think it was
          always very low quality midi music.  It wasn't that way though, it was played off of a cd, and it sounded slightly better. I got the cd version 
          but finding it took a little while longer than it did for other soundtracks. 
        </p>
        <br>
      <p>9. I think it's a not a good idea to listen to music in a game against a difficult human opponent, but sometimes good if you're practicing against an ai, or if you
        are sure you're going to win, it can be nice.  I definitely used to listen to it all the time as a kid, maybe i didn't know how to turn it off or thought it was wrong
        to turn it off.  It's probably still wrong to turn off the age of mythology soundtrack while playing age of mythology.
